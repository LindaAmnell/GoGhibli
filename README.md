Go Ghibli
TypeScript + React

In this project, the goal was to integrate TypeScript into a larger React application while practicing fundamental concepts like AJAX, data validation, and styling. The app was built to display films from Studio Ghibli using data fetched from their API.

Key Features:

✔ Film data fetched from Studio Ghibli API

✔ TypeScript used throughout: for variables, state, and function types, including type aliases for API data

✔ Data Validation with Joi to ensure proper structure and values

✔ Search functionality to find films by their English titles from the fetched data

✔ Sort by release year: films are displayed with the most recent first

✔ Display film details: English title, description, at least one image, and the director

✔ Favorites: Users can mark films as favorites, and view them in a separate favorites view

✔ Reorder favorites: Users can change the order of films in the favorites view

✔ Toggle film status: Users can mark whether they’ve seen a film or not in the favorites view
